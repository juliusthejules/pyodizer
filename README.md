# Pyodizer

**Pyodizer** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) & Python configuration tool designed to help anonymize devices, block both internal & external IP traffic, disable telemetry, configure firewall rules, and enhance encryption. This project offers a secure and private way to control your network and device settings, ensuring your data and activities remain safe from external surveillance.

## Features

- **Device Anonymization**: Disables MAC addresses for increased privacy.
- **IP Configuration**: Restricts both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic to localhost, effectively blocking both internal & external access.
- **Firewall Rules**: Blocks all ports and closes all pings to secure device communications.
- **Telemetry**: Disabled by default to prevent data collection.
- **Hostname & DNS**: Set to localhost to prevent external hostname resolution.
-  **Cookies**: Clears existing cookies and blocks new cookies to prevent even more forms of tracking.
-  **Cache**: All cache is temporary and loads only necessary components of the Pyodizer PWA, ensuring as much privacy as possible.
-  **Hyperlinks**: All hyperlink rel's are loaded as `noopener noreferrer` for optimal privacy.
- **Encryption**: Uses AES-256 encryption to secure configurations.
